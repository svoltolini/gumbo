# Security Issue #55 Verification — Family Revocation Credential Isolation

> Historical record: names and source paths use current Gumbo spelling for navigation. Results predate the new app identity; see [identity and distribution](GUMBO-IDENTITY.md).

**Issue:** [#55 - Failed family revocation leaves stale credentials accessible](https://github.com/svoltolini/gumbo/issues/55)

**Severity:** P1 Release Blocker

**Status:** VERIFIED — Implementation complete in batch 3

## Security Requirements

From the original finding:
> When family sharing removal fails (CloudKit unavailable, partial acknowledgement), previously shared credentials and profile access may remain available to revoked members.

## Verification Summary

### 1. CloudKit Acknowledgement Before Credential Rotation

**Requirement:** Credentials must not be rotated until CloudKit confirms share deletion.

**Implementation:** `AppModel.stopFamilySharing()` (line 816-858)
- Sets `pendingRevocationScope` BEFORE CloudKit call
- Awaits `cloud.stopSharing()` for CloudKit acknowledgement
- Only calls `rotateFamilyAccess()` after CloudKit success
- Returns error and preserves pending state on CloudKit failure

**Test Coverage:**
- `failedOrUnacknowledgedShareRemovalNeverRotatesNASPassword` — verifies zero rotations on CloudKit failure/omission

### 2. Pending State Preservation

**Requirement:** Failed revocation must preserve recovery state for retry.

**Implementation:** `FamilyAccessRecord.pendingRevocationScope` persists across:
- CloudKit failures
- NAS rotation failures  
- App relaunch

**Test Coverage:**
- `partialRevocationSurvivesRelaunchAndRetriesAfterShareAlreadyRemoved` — verifies state survives relaunch
- `pendingRevocationKeepsItsOriginalNASAccountUntilCompleted` — verifies account preserved

### 3. Context Validation for Retries

**Requirement:** Retries cannot switch Apple Account, family, NAS, or profile session.

**Implementation:**
- `sharingScopeIdentifier` encodes account + zone owner
- `checkFamilyContext()` validates connection + profile session
- Account change invalidates generation and cancels operations

**Test Coverage:**
- `revocationRetryDoesNotSwitchAppleAccountOrNAS` — verifies scope validation
- `missedAppleAccountChangeDoesNotDeleteTheNewAccountsShare` — verifies account mismatch detection
- `accountChangeDuringNASRotationRetainsOriginalRecoveryAndDoesNotPublish` — verifies mid-operation safety

### 4. Credential Suppression During Pending Revocation

**Requirement:** Stale credentials must not be published while revocation is pending.

**Implementation:** `AppModel.familyInfo` (line 620)
```swift
let access = familyRevocationPending ? nil : familyAccess
```

**Test Coverage:**
- `pendingRevocationSuppressesFamilyCredentialsFromCloudKitPublication` (NEW) — verifies credentials are nil during pending state

### 5. Operation Blocking During Pending State

**Requirement:** Other family operations must be blocked while revocation is pending.

**Implementation:** Guards in:
- `setUpFamilyAccess()` — line 704
- `rotateFamilyAccess()` — line 775
- `removeFamilyAccess()` — line 802
- `useFamilyAccess()` — line 753-755 (allows re-verification of same account only)

**Test Coverage:**
- `pendingRevocationKeepsItsOriginalNASAccountUntilCompleted` — verifies operations blocked
- `overlappingFamilyChangesCannotReplaceTheRevocationTarget` — verifies concurrent protection

## Test File Summary

**`FamilyAccessTests.swift`** — 15 tests covering:

| Test | Security Property |
|------|-------------------|
| `nasIdentitySeparatesPortsAndAccountsAndCanonicalizesOrigins` | Source ID uniqueness |
| `familyCredentialsStayBoundToOriginAndProvisioningAccountAcrossRelaunch` | Credential persistence |
| `unscopedLegacyFamilyCredentialsAreNotAdopted` | Legacy credential rejection |
| `supersededFamilyVerificationCannotAttachToAnotherNAS` | Concurrent verification protection |
| `failedFamilyRemovalRetainsRecoveryDetails` | Removal failure handling |
| `failedOrUnacknowledgedShareRemovalNeverRotatesNASPassword` | CloudKit failure → no rotation |
| `pendingRevocationSuppressesFamilyCredentialsFromCloudKitPublication` | Credential suppression during pending |
| `partialRevocationSurvivesRelaunchAndRetriesAfterShareAlreadyRemoved` | Persistence and retry |
| `revocationRetryDoesNotSwitchAppleAccountOrNAS` | Scope validation |
| `missedAppleAccountChangeDoesNotDeleteTheNewAccountsShare` | Account change detection |
| `accountChangeDuringNASRotationRetainsOriginalRecoveryAndDoesNotPublish` | Mid-operation safety |
| `missingOrLegacyFamilySecretNeverReportsNASRevocationComplete` | Missing credential handling |
| `profileLockDuringFamilyVerificationCannotPublishCredentials` | Profile lock during verification |
| `pendingRevocationKeepsItsOriginalNASAccountUntilCompleted` | Account preservation |
| `overlappingFamilyChangesCannotReplaceTheRevocationTarget` | Concurrency protection |

## Tester Notes

### Unit Test Execution
Run the family access test suite:
```bash
swift test --filter FamilyAccessTests
```

Expected: 15 tests pass (0 failures)

### Device Acceptance Journeys

The following manual journeys require device testing:

1. **Owner stops sharing while member offline:**
   - Owner: Stop sharing → CloudKit acknowledges → NAS password rotates
   - Member device offline during revocation
   - Member comes online → sees "invitation needed" message
   - Member attempts NAS connection → credentials rejected (password changed)

2. **Failed CloudKit during stop sharing:**
   - Disable network during "Stop sharing"
   - Verify pending state persists
   - Restore network and retry
   - Verify successful completion

3. **NAS rotation failure recovery:**
   - Stop sharing with NAS temporarily unreachable
   - Verify CloudKit share deleted but pending state remains
   - Reconnect to NAS and retry
   - Verify password rotation completes

4. **Apple Account change during revocation:**
   - Begin stop sharing
   - Sign out of iCloud / switch Apple Account
   - Verify original pending state preserved
   - Sign back in → verify can complete from original account

### Known Limitations (Documented)

- DSM sessions established before revocation may remain active until DSM terminates them
- Watch cached audio tracked separately in #15
- Background URLSession redirect handling is OS-level (not app-controlled)

## Conclusion

The family revocation implementation satisfies all security requirements from issue #55:

1. ✅ CloudKit acknowledgement required before credential rotation
2. ✅ Pending state preserved on failure
3. ✅ Context validation prevents cross-account/NAS operations
4. ✅ Credentials suppressed from publication during pending state
5. ✅ Other operations blocked during pending revocation

The implementation is complete with comprehensive unit test coverage. Manual device acceptance remains for full end-to-end verification.
