# App Review notes for Gumbo Music

This document provides App Store Review with the information needed to evaluate Gumbo Music.

## What Gumbo does

Gumbo Music streams and downloads music from a personal Synology NAS (Network Attached Storage). It is not a music-streaming service with its own catalogue—users supply their own music files stored on their own NAS hardware.

## Testing without a NAS

Gumbo includes a built-in **sample library** with 12 demonstration albums containing simulated track metadata. This allows full UI and navigation evaluation without real NAS hardware.

### Enabling the sample library

1. Launch a fresh installation on iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV.
2. On Welcome, choose **Explore Sample Library**. On Apple Watch, choose the same button below the phone-sync instructions.
3. Browse the demonstration albums and playlists. No NAS, login or developer launch arguments are required.

On Apple Watch the sample supports browsing only; playback requires downloaded audio. Phone, Mac and TV sample playback is simulated.

**Note:** The sample library simulates playback (progress bar, time display, transport controls) but does not produce audio output because no actual audio files are bundled. This is expected behavior for review purposes.

### What can be tested with the sample library

| Feature | Testable |
|---------|----------|
| Library browsing (albums, artists, genres) | Yes |
| Search | Yes |
| Playlists (view, create, edit) | Yes |
| Simulated playback controls | Yes |
| Profile creation and switching | Yes |
| Settings and preferences | Yes |
| Widget configuration | Yes |
| CarPlay interface | Yes (simulator) |
| Watch app navigation | Yes |
| Audio output | No (no bundled audio) |
| Real downloads | No (requires NAS) |

## Testing with real NAS hardware

If App Review has access to a Synology NAS or wishes to test full functionality:

1. **NAS requirement:** Synology DiskStation running DSM 7.x or later with File Station enabled
2. **Network:** The review device and NAS must be on the same local network, or accessible via Tailscale
3. **Credentials:** A standard DSM user account with read access to the music folder

The owner can provide temporary demo NAS credentials upon request. Contact information is in App Store Connect.

| App Groups | Share data between main app and widgets |
| CarPlay Audio | Display playback controls on vehicle screen |
| Background Audio | Continue playback when app is backgrounded |

## Privacy

- No analytics SDK or advertising framework
- No data sent to developer servers
- CloudKit data stored in user's private iCloud container
- NAS credentials stored in device Keychain
- See in-app Privacy Details for full disclosure

## Export compliance

`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` is set to `false` for all targets. Gumbo uses only:
- Apple-provided HTTPS/TLS for NAS and iCloud connections
- Apple-provided CloudKit encryption
- Apple Keychain for credential storage

No custom or non-exempt encryption algorithms are implemented.

## Contact

For review questions or temporary NAS access, contact the developer through App Store Connect or the support URL provided in app metadata.
