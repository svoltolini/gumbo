## Automation Notes

### Pre-Upload Checklist Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run before every TestFlight upload

echo "=== Gumbo Pre-Upload Validation ==="

# Check version consistency
echo "Checking version numbers..."
grep -E "CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION:" project.yml | head -5

# Verify privacy manifests exist
echo "Checking privacy manifests..."
for manifest in Gumbo/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy \
                GumboWidgets/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy \
                GumboWatch/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy \
                GumboMac/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy \
                GumboTV/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy; do
  if [ -f "$manifest" ]; then
    echo "✅ $manifest"
  else
    echo "❌ $manifest MISSING"
  fi
done

echo "=== Validation Complete ==="
```

### CI Integration

For automated validation in CI:

1. Build all Release archives
2. Run `xcrun altool --validate-app` on exports
3. Verify entitlements with `codesign -d --entitlements`
4. Check privacy manifest presence in archives
