# App Store Connect checklist for Gumbo Music 1.0

This checklist documents the remaining App Store Connect (ASC) configuration steps required before public release. These items must be completed in the ASC web interface—they cannot be configured in the repository.

## Current Gumbo identity — acceptance pending

The September 20 rename created a separate app identity. Source configuration, platform builds and a signed development iPhone build have been checked. The app/widget IDs, app group and CloudKit container are registered, and CarPlay is enabled for Gumbo. Explicit Watch registration, distribution profiles/archives, App Store Connect configuration, production CloudKit and fresh device/TestFlight acceptance remain pending. Track those gates in [#118](https://github.com/svoltolini/gumbo/issues/118) and evidence reconciliation in [#119](https://github.com/svoltolini/gumbo/issues/119).

## Historical checklist entries — previous app identity

The entries below are the prior release record, not verification of the new Gumbo identity. Historical evidence is preserved through [immutable references](evidence/README.md). Its external state was not reverified during the September 20 source remediation.

- [x] **Privacy manifests** — All 5 targets (iOS, Widgets, Watch, Mac, TV) include `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`
- [x] **Export compliance** — `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false` in all Info.plist configurations
- [x] **CarPlay entitlement** — Approved and present in signed iOS binary and provisioning profile
- [x] **tvOS Top Shelf assets** — 1x and 2x images for both standard (1920×720, 3840×1440) and wide (2320×720, 4640×1440)
- [x] **Watch app icons** — Complete set for all Watch sizes (38mm through 49mm)
- [x] **iOS/Mac app icons** — Present in asset catalogue
- [x] **tvOS brand assets** — App Icon stack layers present
- [x] **Build version alignment** — `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` consistent across all 5 targets
- [x] **CloudKit entitlements** — Production environment configured
- [x] **App Groups** — Configured for widget data sharing
- [x] **Archive validation** — iOS/Watch/Widgets, Mac, and TV Release archives pass export validation
- [x] **TestFlight upload** — All platforms verified as VALID / IN_BETA_TESTING (build 202609142150)
- [ ] **App Review demo mode** — A visible sample-library entry is implemented in the September 20 remediation. Signed screen validation remains pending; see `APP_REVIEW_NOTES.md`.
