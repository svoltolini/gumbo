# Gumbo 1.0 — Device Acceptance Checklist

**For: Tester/Sam**  
**Build**: Record the exact new Gumbo build below.
**Date**: _______________

This is the manual testing checklist for TestFlight device acceptance. Complete this **after** running `scripts/preflight-validation.sh` which checks release configuration and core tests. Run the GumboUITests scheme separately for simulator interaction tests.

The previous app's build 202609142150 does not validate the new Gumbo identity. Record signed-device evidence in [#118](https://github.com/svoltolini/gumbo/issues/118) and [#119](https://github.com/svoltolini/gumbo/issues/119); leave unexecuted checks pending.
