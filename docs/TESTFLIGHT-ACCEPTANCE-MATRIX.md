# Gumbo 1.0 — TestFlight Acceptance Matrix

This document defines the complete acceptance testing required before making Gumbo 1.0 publicly available. It consolidates requirements from [#12](https://github.com/svoltolini/gumbo/issues/12) and the [release audit](RELEASE-AUDIT-2026-09-14.md).

**Current TestFlight build**: 1.0 (202609151900)  
**Audit baseline**: `73f85b74ab60a9707de2f744161b172d21ef5b4e`

## Testing Layers

| Layer | Scope | Runner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit tests | Core logic, state management, persistence | `swift test` / CI |
| Preflight validation | Build settings, privacy manifests, signatures | `scripts/preflight-validation.sh` |
| Simulator smoke | UI rendering, basic flows | Xcode / CI |
| Device acceptance | Real hardware, NAS, network, accessories | Tester (manual) |
| Provider integration | DSM, CloudKit, Tailscale routes | Tester (manual) |

---

## Automated In-Repo Validation

These checks run without physical devices or TestFlight and are captured in `scripts/preflight-validation.sh`.

### Package Tests (190+ tests)

Run the full GumboCore test suite:

```bash
cd Packages/GumboCore && swift test
```

Coverage areas:
- Profile authorization and persistence
- Download state, restoration, and reliability
- Catalogue caching and migration
- CloudKit sync reliability
- Family access and authorization
- Widget authorization
- Playback recovery
- Connection and transport validation

### Build Validation

Verify all targets compile for Release:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Gumbo.xcodeproj -scheme Gumbo -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build
xcodebuild -project Gumbo.xcodeproj -scheme GumboMac -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' build
xcodebuild -project Gumbo.xcodeproj -scheme GumboTV -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=tvOS' build
```

### Version Alignment

All targets must share the same version numbers:

| Target | MARKETING_VERSION | CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gumbo (iOS) | 1.0 | 202609151900 |
| GumboWidgets | 1.0 | 202609151900 |
| GumboWatch | 1.0 | 202609151900 |
| GumboMac | 1.0 | 202609151900 |
| GumboTV | 1.0 | 202609151900 |

### Privacy Manifest Validation

All five targets must include a PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file with:
- `NSPrivacyTracking: false`
- `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes` declarations
- `NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes` with reasons

Locations:
- `Gumbo/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`
- `GumboWidgets/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`
- `GumboWatch/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`
- `GumboMac/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`
- `GumboTV/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`

### Entitlements Check

Verify required capabilities in signed binaries:
- **iOS**: App Groups, CloudKit, CarPlay (approved), Push Notifications
- **Mac**: Sandbox, Network Client, CloudKit, Push Notifications
- **TV**: CloudKit, Push Notifications
- **Watch**: Companion app bundle identifier

### Export Compliance

All Info.plist files must declare:
```
ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false
```
